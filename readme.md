# Recreation of Bella Sara Stable Game

References:
- Textures and sounds:
  - https://bellasara.wiki.gg/wiki/Bella_Sara_Wiki
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaQ2FjKgHKQ&t=627s - shows care of some different horses and has music off (for clearer sounds)
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVlLQOMo2Ow - has some of the animations (played all animations available in menu for classic horses) and shows the whole screen
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw-J5skHzrE - has clear sounds from the foal version, many of which are the same,  and no music
- Code and sprites:
  - https://phaser.io/ - game framework to simplify things
    - https://github.com/phaserjs/examples/blob/master/public/src/animation/animation%20get%20progress.js - use for progress bars
  - https://codeshack.io/images-sprite-sheet-generator/ to make sprite sheets from individual images
  - https://www.joshmorony.com/how-to-create-animations-in-phaser-with-a-texture-atlas/ - not sure if this would fix the issue that occurs when trying to use pixel perfect selection for interactive items?
    - https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/
  - https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2020/phaser-3-parcel-typescript-spine/ - is probably the best option for the horse animations (so it can be animated in parts instead of using entire frames)

## Progress
- [ ] basic functionality
  - [x] drink water
  - [x] remove dirty straw
  - [x] add new straw
  - [x] brush
  - [ ] small brush (still need textures for this one)
  - [x] hoofpick
  - [x] food
  - [x] apple
  - [x] music on/off
  - [ ] track hunger, cleanliness, happiness
  - [ ] click card for positive message
  - [ ] click horseshoe for good luck
  - [ ] glow to show which objects can be interacted with
- [ ] animations
  - [ ] Idle animations should be chosen randomly and start after a random delay. [onCompleteEvent](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\animation\on%20complete%20event.js) could be used to queue the next animation, and random numbers could be used to pick an animation and start it after a [random delay](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\animation\random%20delay.js)
  - *horse animations should be made to work with the body in parts (using [spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) animations?) to make adding multiple horses easier and to hopefully use less file space*
